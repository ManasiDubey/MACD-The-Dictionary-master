Dictionary is the most used application nowadays. So we thought to implement a dictionary with many more features added.

The main feature is obviously to search for a meaning of a particular word. We are not just showing the meaning of the word entered but also its full definition, example, synonyms and antonyms.

In many of the dictionaries when we enter a wrong word it shows “no results found” but in our case we have implemented a function which displays many words similar to the entered word.

We have also added a function which shows some of the words recently searched. It helps the user to memorize the words as sometimes it happens that you forgot the words you searched for before but you want to search the meaning again because you forgot it.

Another feature added is word of the day. Here we print a new word generated randomly from memory and its description everyday so that user can learn a new word each day and improve their vocabulary.

Translator is one of more features included. It translates the English word into French or Spanish as per the users’ choice.
